      <h2>What is a Lump Sum Investment?</h2>
      <p>
        A Lump Sum Investment allows you to invest a once-off amount of money into a professionally managed portfolio, with the goal of growing your wealth over time. Whether you're investing R20,000 or R2 million, this is a flexible and effective way to put your money to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike monthly contributions, a lump sum gives your investment a head start, allowing compounding returns to start working immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Choose a Lump Sum Investment?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>One-Time Contribution:</strong> Invest once—no monthly debit orders or commitments required.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Access:</strong> Choose between short-, medium-, or long-term investment horizons depending on your goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailored Portfolios:</strong> Your money is invested according to your risk appetite—whether conservative, balanced, or aggressive.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversified Growth:</strong> Funds are spread across shares, bonds, property, and cash for optimal risk-adjusted returns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Perfect for Goals Like:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Investing an inheritance or work bonus</li>
        <li>Saving for a child’s education or wedding</li>
        <li>Planning a future deposit on a home</li>
        <li>Building long-term wealth for retirement or financial freedom</li>
      </ul>
