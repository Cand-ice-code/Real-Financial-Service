      <h2>What is a Tax-Free Savings Investment?</h2>
      <p>
        A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a smart, simple way to grow your money without paying tax on the interest, dividends, or capital gains. It’s ideal for medium- to long-term goals like education, a first home deposit, or simply building wealth—100% tax-free.
